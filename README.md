## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (not working for tablet or mobile phone didn't had time to)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about building your own component in JS and all the nesting that come with it. It was nice to work on such a little thing that need so much work. I passed more than 12 hours to do this result ^^.

### Continued development

I plan on doing a lot more of those challenges in the future to show myself and other what I can do in web developement
